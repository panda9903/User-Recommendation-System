# User-Recommendation-System

This user recommendation system is used to recommend products to users who already bought some products in e-commerce website.
We used Singluar Value Decomposition technique(SVD) to make the correlation matrix, and recommend products.
We used pandas, numpy, nltk, scilit-learn and many other libraries for making the model

The file `User_based_collaborative_filtering` recommends products based on ranking and past purchases, whereas the `Model_based_collaborative_filtering` recommends products based on similar users using collaborative filtering.

We can combine both the algorithms for getting the most personalised recommendations.
